## To analyze the increase in cancer rate globally
### Tool used POWERBI
### power query for data cleaning and preparation
## INSIGHTS
### From my Analysis I observed that the Average survival years across the age categories was 5years.
#### Age was categorized into five(5) groups as Young(20-25),Young Adults(26-35),Middle Age(36-45),Older Adult(46-60),Senior as 60years and above.
Seniors aged 60 years and above have higher rates of genetic risks, Obesity, Smoking, Alcohol use, and Air pollution.
Seniors have a higher survival rates for Stage III while the Young Adult has high survival rate for Stage I
#### Genetic risks was higher in males with about 33.59%.
Cancer stages (stage 0-stage IV).Severity score was high in Stage II cancer stage
Severity score was increase in some countries such as Australia, UK, USA, and India
India records highest for cervical cancer followed by Breast cancer.
USA recorded more prostate cancer
UK recorded more cases of Leukemia
Brazil recorded more of skin and Liver cancer. 
Cancer Types includes Breast, Colon, Cervical, Lung, Liver, Skin, Prostate and Leukemia.
Colon cancer had the highest from Alcohol usage
YEARS
#### 2016 recorded the highest rates of cancer globally with Prostate cancer as the highest followed by 2020 with Colon cancer as the highest cases respectively.

#### Some of the reasons why the Seniors aged 60 years and above had the highest risk includes: 
Genetic risks : can accumulate overtime as a result of exposure to various risks factors and also cancer incidence increases with Age
Obesity : Older adults may have age related metabolic changes which contribute to obesity. Lifelong eating habits can also accumulate over the years
Smoking :  due to historical norms, many Aged adults started smoking decades ago when it was less stigmatized compare to the younger generations
Alcohol use : cumulative effects of decades of exposure to alcohol combined with the body's decreased in its ability to repair DNA and weakened immune system as they age 
Air pollution :  lifetime exposure to carcinogens as a result of staying longer periods outdoors and the body's inability to repair cellular damage and response to environmental stressors and also a higher prevalence of an existing health conditions.
## RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Targeted health campaigns aimed at reducing obesity, lifestyles and healthier eating habits should be encouraged especially for the old and aged  such as heathy eating habits, physical exercise and regular health screening
#### Smoking cessation programs tailored at the old and aged taking into accounts their challenges and decades of experiences and lifestyle
#### Air pollutions : Environmental health initiatives for advocating  for policies aimed at reducing air pollution, particularly in areas with high senior population. Also promote awareness of the impacts of air pollution on health
#### Alcohol use : Increased awareness about the risks of alcohol consumption in old age and the effects on organs
#### Genetic counselling should be encouraged and practiced especially in families with history of cancer. Health Education should be provided for those without knowledge of genetic diseases and its effects
#### Creation of community engagements that promotes physical activities, social engagement, access to healthy food options that promotes cellular immunity
#### Advocates for policies that support healthcare access, mental health resources, preventive health care especially for the old and aged should be promoted in countries with higher cancer rates
#### Rehabilitations programs can be established for the older adults living with Obesity, smoking, alcohol use, offering also peer group support and educational resources.
#### Integrated health Care Approach that address multiple risk factors simultaneously, such as combined programs for obesity, smoking, and alcohol use should be approached
#### Medic Aid, Charity care should be provided  by the governments or NGOs to relieve cancer patients of financial stress and struggles.

### Additionally, Educational and Enlightenment programs should be organized for the younger generations to Educate them on the impact of environmental and genetic risks associated with Cancer.
The younger generations should be made aware that their choices and lifestyle today can lead to cancer in the future

### In summary while the younger ones may exhibit higher rates of certain risky rates of behaviors, The older ones face a combination of  risk factors that can lead to higher rates of Obesity, Alcohol use ,smoking which ultimately leads to Cancer.
